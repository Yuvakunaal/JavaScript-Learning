// Sync in JS :-

// Synchronous :-
// Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in a program. 
// Each instruction awaits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

// Asynchronous :-
// Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp intstructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, // which causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronous code executes allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.
